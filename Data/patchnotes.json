    "paragraph": "We're working on a logo competition. The winner of this competition will have their logo be the new logo for Informare and will become the new Graphic Designer. No head staff can participate and staff that win will have their job title switched. We need 2 logos, one that is just a symbol and then one with a symbol and text. Submissions will be due May 10 and submission will be open on May 1st or earlier. Contact me if you have any further questions."

    "header": "Added News and Music 2.8.9.9(Beta)",
    "paragraph": "I have added a news feature that allows the chosen writer to give you a news story written by every once in a while. While this won\u2019t be daily like the daily message, the new feature also includes more text customization. The news feature includes custom text size, colored text, images, links, heading, functional buttons, and more. This was pulled off by letting the news writer make a basic HTML document and sending the code to the server. I have also added a music feature. Every page will have music and will start playing when you interact with the page. I later plan to add a setting to disable this, but for now you will have to just mute the tab or your computer. I hope you all appreciate the features I have added. This will be the last beta update, and the next update will be the final accounts updates, so a vote on the next major update is coming."

    "paragraph": "I have fixed the issues the community requested to be fixed. I first merged posting and viewing to the same page. The next fix is I made underscores spaces and fixed tags colors. The final major fixes I made were making new posts go to the top, and when you post or delete a message the page doesn\u2019t refresh, but recollects the posts. I have also cleaned out old alt accounts."

    "header": "New Policy, Improved HomeworkManager, and Posting 2.8.9(Beta)",
    "paragraph": "This new update has been a long time coming so let's get caught up. The first subject is our new policy. We have introduced a new system of authority. This new system includes creating a board consisting of Admin(Me), Daily Messenger, Head Moderator, Head Judge, and Designer. This will hopefully distribute responsibility making this easier on my work. Now we will go over the improved homework manager. I have updated the UI allowing you to keep track of the name of the assignment, how many points it\u2019s worth, its due date, and you can also add notes to the assignment. It will also tell you if an assignment is due soon, while saving all the info to your account, fixing the major issue with the previous homework manager. Finally we will talk about the last, but most important feature, the posting feature. I have made a feature where you can post a public message, with a category for the rest of the community to read. I have also made sure to give the option to delete any message you post. Our moderation branch will take the duty to watch and control these chats. We plead that you use this responsibly for kindness, helping each other, and a safe place to talk to people. We hope you enjoy what I have made."

These messages are intentionally lighthearted, possibly including playful misinformation for satirical purposes and generally unrelated to educational content. On another note, there's a new team member at Informare, responsible for crafting the latest daily messages. Loading animations have been introduced on specific pages to signal communication between Informare and the server. I hope you enjoy the fresh daily messages!"

We hope this does not cause too much inconvenience for you."

    "header": "ProVersion, Accounts, and Banning 2.8.3(Beta)",

You can now change your password, which also resets and clears all existing tokens, enhancing security. There's also an option to reset tokens, which logs out all devices connected to your account, though they can still re-access using the password. Additionally, deleting your account is now a straightforward option. I'm happy to report that the auto-login issue has been fixed, ensuring smoother functionality. Looking ahead, the next update will introduce a chat feature, enabling users to participate in public threads for various activities like seeking assignment help or casual chatting. These enhancements are just the beginning. My vision for Informare is to evolve it into a comprehensive hub for all school-related matters, expanding well beyond its initial scope. Exciting developments are on the horizon!"

You'll soon be able to add your own profile pictures, ensuring a more tailored experience. Moreover, we're enhancing data security and persistence; even if your local storage is cleared or deleted, your data will remain safe and accessible. To further ensure your security, it's crucial to remember not to share your passwords with anyone, as this is a key part of protecting your personal information and maintaining the integrity of your account. These features, along with many other enhancements, are on the horizon, all made possible by the implementation of user accounts. Stay tuned for these exciting updates!"

    "header": "Themes 2.7",
    "paragraph": "I have added Light, Custom, and Night themes. Custom themes allow you to set the background color to whatever you want, and the rest of the page will adjust accordingly. I have also redesigned the site by reducing empty space, removing unnecessary colons, and redesigning the schedule box to have the header above the category, instead of a colon separating them. Additionally, I implemented a protection system to safeguard against the bypassing of features still in development. This system is currently inactive but will be a significant security enhancement when activated. Furthermore, dates have been added to the schedule boxes, complete with a hovering animation for a more dynamic user experience. To keep users informed, I've introduced an update pop-up screen that summarizes the main features of each update. I hope you all enjoy these updates and find the new features beneficial."
